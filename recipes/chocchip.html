    <h4>One of my all time favorite chocolate chip recipes from Bon
        Appetit.
    </h4>
    <p>
        This recipe for brown butter chocolate chip cookies will ruin
         you for all other cookies. It comes from BA subscriber Kate 
         Davis, a winner in our 2017 Readers’ Choice Week contest. 
         Davis’s recipe produces cookies with crispy, lacy edges and 
         gooey centers studded with lots of melty chocolate. Then 
         there’s the kicker: crunchy bits of buttery toffee candy.

        The key to the best chocolate chip cookies is in the details. 
        Here, that means simmering melted butter until the milk solids
         turn golden brown and give off a nutty aroma. Don’t even think
         about straining out those brown bits: they’re imbued with 
         toasty, rich flavor that will enhance the cookies’ caramel-
         like notes. Davis also opts for high-end bittersweet 
         chocolate wafers—not chocolate chips, or even chocolate 
         chunks—which melt into pools that defy logic, remaining 
         molten days after baking. Last: Yes, it is important to bring
         the ingredients to room temperature before you start mixing.
         If you want chewy, perfect chocolate chip cookies, don’t 
         skip it.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>227g Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>250g AP Flour</li>
        <li>1t Baking Soda</li>
        <li>3/4t Baking Soda</li>
        <li>215g Dark Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>73g Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>2t Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>80g Skor Toffee Bars, chopped into 1/4" pieces</li>
        <li>216g Chocolate Wafers, 72% cacao</li>
        <li>(optional) Maldon Salt</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 227 g unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium
             heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5–8 
             minutes. Scrape into a large bowl and let cool slightly, 
             until cool enough to touch (like the temperature of a warm 
             bath), about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk 250 g all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. baking 
            soda, and ¾ tsp. salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 215 g dark brown sugar and 73 g granulated sugar to the
             browned butter. Using an electric mixer (either a stand 
             mixer or hand mixer) on medium speed, beat until 
             incorporated, about 1 minute. Add 2 eggs, room temperature
             and 2 tsp. vanilla extract, increase mixer speed to 
             medium-high, and beat until mixture lightens and begins to 
             thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low; add dry 
             ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix in 80g Skor 
             toffee bars, chopped into ¼" pieces and 216 g chocolate 
             wafers with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Let dough 
             sit in the mixing bowl at room temperature at least 30 
             minutes to allow flour to hydrate. Dough will look very 
             loose at first, but will thicken as it sits.</li>
        <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°, and line a
             baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a 1-oz. ice cream
              scoop, portion out balls of dough and place on prepared 
              baking sheet, spacing about 3" apart (you can also form 
              dough into ping pong–size balls with your hands). Do not 
              flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with 
              flaky sea salt.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but 
            centers are still soft, 9–11 minutes. Let cool on baking 
            sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let 
            cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough, using a cool 
            baking sheet lined with fresh parchment paper.</li>
    </ol>
