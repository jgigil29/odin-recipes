    <h4>Golden biscuits in a cloth lined basket, just like Nana used to make.
    </h4>
    <p>Southern style biscuits were always a staple growing up in 
        East Tennessee. I spent years only making them from a can,
         but since I started really learning how to cook I haven't
         made them from a can in years.</p>
    <p>The ingredients and process for making biscuits are 
        incredibly simple. What is important to remember though, 
        is to have your ingredients cold as possible and work 
        fast. The oven needs to be ripping hot, so make sure that
        you give it at least 30 minutes to heat thoroughly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1000g Lily White Flour, Pastry or AP is fine as well</li>
        <li>40g Baking Powder</li>
        <li>30g Salt</li>
        <li>20g Sugar</li>
        <li>360g Butter,cold</li>
        <li>400g Buttermilk,cold</li>
        <li>400g Whole Milk, cold</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For best results I like to chop up my butter into 1cm 
            cubes and freeze overnight.(optional)</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Thoroughly whisk dry ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pulse the butter with a small amount of the dry mix in a 
            food processor until the pieces are roughly the size of 
            popcorn kernels.</li>
        <li>Pour butter mixture into the dry ingredients, whisk again, 
            and form a well in the center.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl combine the wet ingredients and 
            give it a stir.</li>
        <li>Add the milks to the center of the well and start folding 
            the flour into the milk until a wet dough forms. Be sure 
            not to overmix at this point, as this will result in tough
             biscuits.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a heavily floured work surface and 
            dust more flour onto the top.</li>
        <li>Begin to roll out the dough into a rectangle, cut it in 
            half, and stack. Repeat this process 3 times, working 
            quickly.</li>
        <li>When the dough has been once again rolled out to about 1 
            inch thick, start to cut out the biscuits. Be sure to 
            flour your biscuit cutter or knife to prevent sticking. Be
             sure to press straigth down and do <b>not</b> twist or saw.
            This can seal the edges and prevent the biscuits from 
            rising properly </li>
        <li>Place the cut biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet. I 
            like to place them about an inch apart. This helps them 
            rise and keeps the edges soft.</li>
        <li>Pour a splash of water, milk, or heavy cream into the 
            beaten egg and brush the mixture onto the tops of the 
            biscuits. </li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for about 20 mintues, or until the tops
             are a deep golden brown</li>
    </ol>
